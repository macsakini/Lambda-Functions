# BuySA Functions

This repo is a combination of four packages that combines all functions available for lambdas in aws.

Upload the jar in the artifacts after the workflow runs to lambda and test wirh already made tests.

The functions include
- New Order
- New Customer
- Metrics and Webhooks

To add a new function add a new package in a similar fashion to keep readability and scalability possible.
